      <p class="poem">
        From the very first sketch to the final design, <br />
        Every pixel, every color—your magic aligns. ✨ <br />
        Your hands weave dreams, so subtle, so fine, <br />
        Turning blank screens into art divine. 🎨💻 <br />
        <br />
        Through sleepless nights and endless tries, <br />
        You painted your path with hopeful sighs. <br />
        When doubts knocked loud, you held on tight, <br />
        You fought, you rose, you reached new heights. 🚀 <br />
        <br />
        Oh, Shreya, my sunshine, my pride, my queen, <br />
        Do you see how far you’ve been? 👑 <br />
        The world now knows what I always knew, <br />
        That brilliance and beauty both live in you. 💖 <br />
        <br />
        Not just a designer, but a heart so kind, <br />
        A soul so rare, a brilliant mind. 🧠💡 <br />
        In colors, in fonts, in strokes so grand, <br />
        You build not just visuals—you craft dreams by hand. <br />
        <br />
        And today, my darling, the world takes note, <br />
        Your talent shines, your name they quote. ✨ <br />
        No longer a dream, it’s real, it’s true, <br />
        The job is yours, and I’m so proud of you! <br />
        <br />
        But this isn’t the end, oh no, not yet, <br />
        This is just your first big step! <br />
        So dream some more, create, explore, <br />
        The universe has so much in store. 🌎 <br />
        <br />
        So walk in strong, head held high, <br />
        Make them stare as you pass by. 😏 <br />
        Because my love, my muse, my star so bright, <br />
        The world just met its next great light. <br />
        <br />
        Forever rooting for you, my love, my Bubu, <br />
        You did it, and I always knew! 💕 <br />
